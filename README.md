The Sieve
=========
##The Sieve - A Simpler And More Personalized Way To Read The News
The Sieve was a project for 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy in Fall 2013.
###What Is The Sieve?
The Sieve is a news aggregator and recommendation application. The Sieve allows users to build a personalized
library of favorite blogs and other websites. It then allows users to open and read the most recent articles posted from
each favoirte online source. Then, using my own originally created "top secret" algorithm, The Sieve will recommend new
articles from websites across the web.
